# Practical 07


## Introduction

Welcome to my practical assignments repository for the CP1404 subject. This repository contains all the practical exercises and projects I have completed throughout the course.
Chriswood Rodney Okwiiri is my name.
I am a student passionate about learning programming and software development. This repository serves as a showcase of my progress and skills gained during the course.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Adopting TDD practices has helped me write more reliable code by writing tests before implementing the actual functionality. It ensures that the code meets the expected requirements and catches bugs early in the development process.
Version Control with Git: Learning how to use Git for version control has been invaluable. It allows me to manage project history effectively, collaborate with team members, and revert changes if necessary.
Code Reviews: Participating in code reviews has taught me the importance of receiving feedback from peers. It helps me improve code quality, learn new techniques, and adhere to best practices.
